# Who am I?

* Mathematician/Statistician with keen interest in 'Data Science' and (deep) machine learning

* Worked several years as analyst in two multi-centric studies: 4C and CENTER-TBI

* Convinced that open science/source is the future

* Sometimes frustrated by the adoption of modern *tooling* in academia

# Data research as software development

- modern empricial research is *highly data-driven*

- make sure that data infrastructure is adequate

- multiple stake-holders (analysts, non-tech experts)

- anything beyond absolute basics: *complex analysis scripts*

- agile development (changing requirements/hypotheses)

- quality control - reproducibility? 





---
class: inverse, middle

&gt; *Data research is essentially about writing a piece of software that
turns data into a manuscript `\(\leadsto\)` adopt lessons learnt from software 
develoment!*

# 'Data is the new oil'



---
# Data = new oil is the perfect methaphor:

- need large enough storage facility (data base = tanks)

- storage must be accessible (data access = pipelines)

- infrastructure must be maintained continuously or becomes 'sticky/stale'

- security!

- on the first look, all data looks the same but there are different kinds of
data (and oil!) that cannot be mixed easily (longitudinal, cross sectional)

&gt; Data = new oil is quite a good methaphor since it indicates 
practical storage/processing problems as well



---
# Data management considerations

- Have a plan and involve domain experts, early!

- Make sure data bases are flexible enough to adapt to changing requirements 

- Think about storage of intermediate data products

- Make sure everything is accessible in a systematic way (APIs?)

- Ensure continuous support maintainance over the entire project timeline

- Do not underestimate the effort of data curation!

- Beware that compex data bases evolve over time, how do you handle versioning/versioned access of your data?

# 'Literate Programming'

&gt; *"I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation of 
programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs to be works
of literature. Hence, my title: 'Literate Programming'."* Donald Knuth, 1984





---
# Literate Programming

- script file with code + comments - ugly, no output

- 'literate program': code, output (graphs, tables), and explanatory text
as equals

- prime example 'notebooks' (Jupyter Notebook): 
  - interactive cell-style programming
  - text can be authored with markdown
  - can be exported to .pdf/.html/...

# Demo: Jupyter Notebook

1. open analysis-notebook.ipynb

2. execute code 'chunks' (focus and shift + enter)

3. export to pdf/html/... via menu bar





---
# Notebooks

.pull-left[

## Pros

1. mix text/output with code

2. export to multiple formats

3. interactive coding style 

4. support most common scripting languages

]



.pull-right[

## Cons

1. plain notebook file not human-readable (json metadata)

2. interactivity: order-of-execution errors

3. limited formatting flexibility

# markdown + knitr + pandoc

# Literate programming with code-chunks (1)

- this presentation is authored in markdown (`slides.Rmd`)!

- easy to use

- source document is readable even with just a text editor

- rich output with templates

### Process:

1. combine markdown text with code in 'chunks'
2. run code chunks with appropriate scripting language (knitr)
3. capture output (text/figures) in extended markdown file (knitr)
4. convert to desired output format using pandoc (allows templates!)








---
# Literate programming with code-chunks (2)

.pull-left[

## Input markdown + code

````
Some text
```{r demo-chunk}
plot(cars)
```
````

]

.pull-right[

## Output (html)

# Workflow Automation


---
# Workflow automation

- complex analyses often require multiple outputs (plots, tables, reports)

- often intermediate files, data sets used by multiple plots etc

- interdependent steps, need to maintain right order of execution

- difficult to update everything if something changes early on

- long running steps should be cached during development

- welcome to workflow hell!





---
# Workflow automation

- bear in mind: analysis = program to go from data to outputs

- should be possible to just specify what you want and have the program figure out what needs to be done (exploiting shared intermediate output)

- caching is super helpful during **development** not so much for reproducibility

- simple bash script (maybe with if clauses for checking for files) may be sufficient in simple cases

- for anything more serious, use a dedicated workflow engine





---
# snakemake

- python tool inspired by GNU make

- represents workflows as DAGs, automatically takes care of running jobs in parallel, caching etc.

- can be used with slurm scheduler to exploit parallelism on an HPC slurm cluster

- python-like syntax, easy to learn




---
# Version Control (git)

- time machine for entire projects

- distributed (no central server)

- robust (designed for wortk on Linux kernel, now also used by Microsoft!)

- **the** standard VCS .



---
# Code hosting 

- git is a command line tool

- GitHub.com/GitLab.com are code hosting platforms that make it more productive

- 





---
# GitHub.com example repo

[demo, show features]



---
# Dependency management

- source code is fine versioned

- workflow is automated

- what could go wrong?

- lots of software dependencies (R/Python/tensorflow/snakemake/LaTeX/...)

- all changing quickly - how can we make sure that the exact computing environment can be replicated in the future?

- package managers not sufficient since cross-language/system level dependencies not captured (openssl version e.g.)




---
# Solution: Containerization

- better: isolate everything but the bare operating system (linux!)

- think: lightweight virtual machine 
- no 'hard drive'
- no hardware virtualization (use host system) - fast!
- images are single files, easily sharable!
  
- those must be complicated...

# Singularity vs. Docker

.pull-left[

Docker

1. made containers 'sexy'

2. widely used by industry to run microservices

3. requires root access to build and **run** `\(\leadsto\)` incompatible with HPC systems

]

.pull-right[

Singularity

1. Relatively new (2016) 'Docker for HPC'

2. Key difference: **root only required for building** containers!

3. Geared towards HPC: reproducible, portable computing environment - run 
arbitrary software on your HPC without bothering your admin! 

4. Integrates with workflow management engines (snakemake, nextflow, etc.) and
HPC

# Summary

- No free lunch: 'Data Research' is complex!

- 'Data Research' is software development, be smart and use their tools!

- Reproducibility of complex analyses paramount to enable thorough review and reuse!

- Literate programming can ease analyst/investigator communication by 
streamlining reliable report generation

- Data hosting + code hosting + containerization + version control can facilitate
collaboration on complex projects

- Better code quality `\(\leadsto\)` more enjoyable coding + more confidence in
results
